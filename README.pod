GopfTool - Augmented User Experience Monitor

=head1 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

An area that has proven to be rather difficult to tackle in performance
monitoring is desktop performance. At the same time, this is where the
rubber hits the road, even when my performance monitor tells me that the
desktop performance is fine, what matters at the end of the day is if the
users feel comfortable with their desktop performance.

So instead of throwing ever larger amounts of technology at the 'problem'
GopfTool centers on the user experience. And provides the user with a very
simple way of reporting problems.

Operation is pretty simple, whenever the user is unhappy about some
technical aspect of his IT environment, she launches the GopfTool and types
her complaint into the comment box and presses send.

This information is then uploaded to the GopfTool server which can also pass
the information on via email for further processing.

Obviously the system will only work when the reports are processed by
other humans who respond and take care of improving the system performance.

=head2 Features

To help IT supporters figure the cause of the problem GopfTool can
customized to fit the local requirements:

=head2 Server

The GopfTool server is responsible for providing the GopfTool clients with
configuration information as well as for processing problem reports.

As problem reports arrive, they are forwarded to an email address of your
choice. At the same time the GopfTool server will collect statistical
information on the problem reports. The more machine readable information is
contained in the reports the more statistical evaluations are possible.

The Statistics are presented in graphical web interface.
